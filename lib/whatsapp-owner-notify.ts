/**
 * Sends approval-needed notifications to the site owner over WhatsApp using
 * Meta's WhatsApp Business Platform (Cloud API). Real, production-shaped
 * code — but inert (returns { sent: false, reason: "not_configured" })
 * until these env vars exist in Render:
 *
 *   WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_TOKEN    permanent access token for your WhatsApp Business app
 *   WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID   the Meta-assigned ID for your business's WhatsApp number
 *   WHATSAPP_OWNER_NUMBER      the owner's number to notify, e.g. 233504115111 (no +)
 *
 * Getting those requires a Meta Developer App with the WhatsApp product
 * added, a verified business phone number, and (for anything beyond a
 * 24-hour test window) an approved message template — none of which can be
 * set up from here. Until configured, approval requests just live in the
 * admin dashboard, which still works fine on its own.
